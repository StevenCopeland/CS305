Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address? Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to incorporate additional security into their already existing application.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? I enjoyed testing potential vulnerabilities in my code via static testing. Secure coding is important to protect not only your property but the property of your users. Personal information and trade secret loss can cause great harm to both people and businesses. Coding secure software helps to secure information and overall helps to protect a company’s reputation in the long run.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? The dependency check tool was the most helpful, it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities Vs. checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? Through testing most of the vulnerabilities were caused by using old libraries so by updating the libraries currently in use in the code more secure software is created. Using penetration testing in the future will better assess the and additional vulnerabilities within the code.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? Through coding the software, I continually ran debugs to ensure that it was functional. After refactoring the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? I used stack overflow quite a bit and checked how peers were solving situations like mine, especially when running into errors in the console.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? My use of a hash function to send encrypted communications.
